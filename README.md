Narrative
A boy , once bright and imaginative, witnesses the sudden tragic death of his older brother, his role model and best friend.
The trauma shatters his world — not just emotionally but metaphysically. His grief manifests as a dreamlike parallel reality called The Quiet, a surreal realm shaped by his sorrow, fears, and fading memories.
